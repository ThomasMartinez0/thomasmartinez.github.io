Hello! Welcome to my webpage. I am a 2nd year PhD Student at UCLA's Math department. I currently do not have an advisor however I am primarily interested in combinatorics.

Before UCLA, I received my B.S. with High Distinction and Honors in Mathematics at Harvey Mudd College, where I wrote my thesis, [The Slice Rank Polynomial Method](https://scholarship.claremont.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1247&context=hmc_theses), under [Mohamed Omar](https://www.mohamedomar.org/). I was also a part of the University of Virginia REU in the Summer of 2020 under the mentorship of [Ken Ono](https://uva.theopenscholar.com/ken-ono) and a part of the Williams College SMALL REU in the Summer of 2019 under the mentorship of [Steven J. Miller](https://web.williams.edu/Mathematics/sjmiller/public_html/).
