I am a 2nd year PhD Student at UCLA's Math department working with [Pavel Galashin.](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~galashin/) I am primarily interested in algebraic and enumerative combinatorics. Before UCLA, I received my B.S. with High Distinction and Honors in Mathematics at Harvey Mudd College in 2021.

This quarter (Spring 2024), I am co-organizing the UCLA Combinatorics Student Seminar and organizing the UCLA Combinatorics Learning Seminar, which is on Coxeter Groups and Root Systems. For a syllabus, see the Writing tab.
