I am a 2nd year PhD Student at UCLA's Math department working with [Pavel Galashin.](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~galashin/) I am primarily interested in algebraic and enumerative combinatorics. I am currently working on problems related to the combinatorics of positroid varieties, affine permutations, and q,t-Catalan numbers. Before UCLA, I received my B.S. with High Distinction and Honors in Mathematics at Harvey Mudd College in 2021.
